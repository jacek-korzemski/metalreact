# MetalReact

Simple app in React that contains and shares videos/albums from 19 metal channels on youtube and some articles from Polish metal blog: Metalmusic.pl

## Where can I find the app?

Right now, you can check the progress here: http://react.metalmusic.pl/

## But where do you get all your data?

It's more optimal to store youtube links, titles and thumbnail url's in own database, so I have backend in CodeIgniter 3, where I store all the video data, and as the article backend - metalmusic.pl based on Wordpress.
